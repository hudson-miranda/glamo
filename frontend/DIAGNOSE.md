# üîç Frontend Diagnosis & Hardening Report

**Date:** 2025-10-22  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Initial fixes applied

---

## 1. Issues Identified

### Previous State
Based on the problem statement, the following issues were reported:
- Sidebar pages showing "There was an error rendering this page"
- Dashboard showing mock data only
- Salon selector showing "No salons available" and cannot create salons
- Topbar has links we won't use (AI Scheduler, Pricing, Docs, Blog)
- UI spacing/layout with duplicated topbar+sidebar
- Auth (login/signup) too basic; no onboarding flows
- Notifications do not work

### Current State Assessment
Upon inspection of the codebase:
- ‚úÖ Dashboard layout exists with Sidebar and Header
- ‚úÖ 9 module pages exist (dashboard, clients, notifications, services, appointments, sales, inventory, cash-register, reports)
- ‚úÖ UI components library from shadcn/ui is already in place
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Dashboard shows mock data (needs real queries)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Salon context exists but userSalons array is empty
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Navigation includes OpenSaaS demo links
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No global error handling
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No onboarding flow

---

## 2. Fixes Applied

### 2.1 Global Error Boundary ‚úÖ
**File:** `app/src/client/providers/ErrorBoundary.tsx`

**Features:**
- Pretty fallback UI with error details
- Console logging with context
- Route name display
- "Try Again" and "Go to Dashboard" actions
- Stack trace in development mode
- Sentry hook-ready (TODO comment)
- Auto-reset on route change

**Implementation:**
```typescript
<ErrorBoundary>
  <App />
</ErrorBoundary>
```

Wraps the entire app in `App.tsx` to catch any rendering errors.

### 2.2 useSafeQuery Hook ‚úÖ
**File:** `app/src/client/hooks/useSafeQuery.ts`

**Features:**
- Normalizes API errors to typed `ApiError` shape
- Attaches metadata: operationName, route, salonId
- Shows error toasts automatically
- Console logging with context
- Sentry hook-ready (TODO comment)
- Custom error handlers

**Usage:**
```typescript
const { data, isLoading, error } = useSafeQuery(
  ['clients', salonId],
  () => listClients({ salonId }),
  {
    operationName: 'listClients',
    showErrorToast: true,
  }
);
```

**Bonus:** `useSalonQuery` - Automatically handles salon context validation.

### 2.3 Navigation Cleanup ‚úÖ
**File:** `app/src/client/components/NavBar/constants.ts`

**Changes:**
- ‚ùå Removed "AI Scheduler (Demo App)"
- ‚ùå Removed "File Upload"
- ‚ùå Removed "Pricing"
- ‚ùå Removed "Documentation"
- ‚ùå Removed "Blog"
- ‚úÖ Kept "Features" for marketing page
- ‚úÖ Empty navigation for authenticated users (they use sidebar)

### 2.4 App Routing Logic ‚úÖ
**File:** `app/src/client/App.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Dashboard pages now bypass the top NavBar completely
- Only shows NavBar on landing/marketing pages
- ErrorBoundary wraps entire app
- Better route detection for dashboard pages

---

## 3. Residual Gaps

### 3.1 Salon Management Issues
**Current State:**
- `useSalonContext` reads `user.activeSalonId` from auth
- `userSalons` array is managed in state but never populated
- No operation to switch active salon
- No onboarding flow to create/join salon

**Needs:**
- Backend operation: `listUserSalons` query
- Backend operation: `switchActiveSalon` action
- Onboarding flow (Prompt 2)
- Populate userSalons in Header component

### 3.2 Dashboard Mock Data
**Current State:**
- Dashboard shows hardcoded values (245 clients, 18 appointments, etc.)

**Needs:**
- Real queries: `listClients`, `listAppointments`, `getSalesReport`
- Stats calculation hooks
- Empty salon state handling
- (Covered in Prompt 4)

### 3.3 Page Errors
**Current State:**
- Pages likely fail when `activeSalonId` is null
- No empty state for "no salon selected"

**Needs:**
- All pages should check for `activeSalonId`
- Show friendly message: "Please select a salon to continue"
- Link to onboarding flow

### 3.4 Notifications
**Current State:**
- Notifications page exists
- Bell icon shows hardcoded badge (3)
- No real unread count

**Needs:**
- Query unread count: `useQuery(listNotifications, { unread: true })`
- Mark as read functionality
- (Covered in Prompt 12)

### 3.5 Auth UX
**Current State:**
- Basic login/signup pages (inherited from OpenSaaS)
- No onboarding after signup

**Needs:**
- Redesigned auth screens
- Onboarding flow integration
- (Covered in Prompt 3)

## 4. Error Handling Strategy

### Client-Side Errors
1. **ErrorBoundary** - Catches component rendering errors
2. **useSafeQuery** - Catches API/query errors
3. **Toast notifications** - User-friendly error messages
4. **Console logs** - Detailed debugging info

### Error Flow
```
API Error ‚Üí useSafeQuery ‚Üí Normalize ‚Üí Toast + Console ‚Üí (Optional) Sentry
```

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Integrate Sentry for production error tracking
- [ ] Add error retry logic for transient failures
- [ ] Implement offline detection
- [ ] Add error analytics dashboard

---

## 5. Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing Needed
- [ ] Navigate to each sidebar page and verify no errors
- [ ] Trigger an error and verify ErrorBoundary catches it
- [ ] Test useSafeQuery with a failing operation
- [ ] Verify navigation links are removed from topbar
- [ ] Test responsive layout on mobile
- [ ] Test dark mode compatibility

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Test error boundary with route changes
- [ ] Test salon context with missing salon
- [ ] Test query errors with toast notifications
