- Configure monitoring (Sentry, DataDog)
- Set up automated backups
- Load testing and optimization

## Known Considerations

1. **Commission Tracking Table:** The commission calculation is integrated but there's no Commission table yet to persistently track commissions. A future enhancement would be to create a Commission model to store calculated commissions for reporting.

2. **Async Report Export:** Reports are currently synchronous. For large datasets, consider implementing async export using PgBoss.

3. **Stock Concurrency:** In high-traffic scenarios, consider implementing optimistic locking for stock updates to prevent race conditions.

4. **Payment Method Configuration:** Payment methods need to be seeded or created via admin interface.

5. **Voucher Management:** Voucher CRUD operations were not implemented in this sprint (they exist in the schema but no operations were created).

## Conclusion

Sprint 3 successfully completes the Glamo salon management system backend implementation. All core business functionality is in place:

✅ Complete sales lifecycle with multi-item support  
✅ Comprehensive inventory management with stock tracking  
✅ Cash register with automatic reconciliation  
✅ Analytical reports for business insights  
✅ Full integration with Sprints 1 & 2  
✅ RBAC security throughout  
✅ Comprehensive audit logging  
✅ Production-ready code quality  

The system is now ready for frontend development, testing, and deployment! 🎉
