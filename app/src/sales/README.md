## Commission Integration

The `commissionIntegration.ts` helper provides commission calculation for sales:

### `calculateSaleCommissions`
Calculates commissions for all items in a sale.

**Parameters:**
- `sale`: Sale object with items and service commission configs
- `context`: Wasp context with entities

**Returns:**
```typescript
Array<{
  professionalId: string;
  itemId: string;
  itemType: 'SERVICE' | 'PRODUCT';
  commissionAmount: number;
  commissionableBase: number;
  details: any;
}>
```

**Process:**
1. For each service, uses commission config to calculate
2. For each product, uses product commission config
3. Returns array of commission records

**Note:** Commission calculation is implemented but commission records are not persisted yet. A future enhancement would be to create a Commission model.

## Business Rules

### Sale Creation
- At least one item (service, product, or package) required
- All items must exist and not be deleted
- Products must have sufficient stock
- Vouchers must be valid (not expired, usage limit not reached)
- Employee must be active in the salon

### Sale Closure
- Payment total must match sale total (within 1 cent tolerance)
- Client credit must have sufficient balance if used
- Stock is automatically deducted for products
- Commissions are calculated but not persisted (placeholder)

### Sale Cancellation
- Can cancel sales in any status (OPEN, CLOSED)
- If CLOSED, stock is automatically reversed
- Original stock movements are recorded for audit

### Client Credits
- Credits can be added manually
- Credits are consumed automatically when used in payments
- Balance is calculated as: amount - sum(credit_payments)
- Credits never expire (business rule can be added)

## Stock Integration

The Sales module integrates tightly with the Inventory module:

1. **On Sale Creation:** Validates product stock availability
2. **On Sale Close:** Automatically deducts product quantities
3. **On Sale Close:** Records stock movements with reason
4. **On Sale Cancel:** Automatically reverses stock if sale was closed
5. **On Sale Cancel:** Records stock reversal movements

## Error Handling

All operations throw `HttpError` with appropriate status codes:

- **401:** User not authenticated
- **403:** No permission or access denied to salon
- **404:** Resource not found (sale, client, employee, etc.)
- **400:** Validation error or business rule violation

## Usage Examples

### Complete Sale Flow

```typescript
// 1. Create sale
const sale = await createSale({
  salonId: 'salon-123',
  clientId: 'client-456',
  employeeId: 'user-789',
  services: [
    {
      serviceId: 'service-haircut',
      professionalId: 'user-789',
      discount: 0
    }
  ],
  products: [
    {
      productId: 'product-shampoo',
      quantity: 1,
      discount: 0
    }
  ]
});

// 2. Close sale with payment
const closed = await closeSale({
  saleId: sale.id,
  salonId: 'salon-123',
  payments: [
    {
      paymentMethodId: 'pm-cash',
      amount: sale.finalTotal
    }
  ]
});

// Sale is now complete, stock is updated
```

### Using Client Credit

```typescript
// 1. Add credit to client
const credit = await addClientCredit({
  salonId: 'salon-123',
  clientId: 'client-456',
  amount: 100,
  origin: 'Promotion',
  notes: 'New client bonus'
});

// 2. Use credit in payment
const closed = await closeSale({
  saleId: 'sale-789',
  salonId: 'salon-123',
  payments: [
    {
      paymentMethodId: 'pm-credit-client',
      amount: 50,
      creditAmount: 50  // Uses client credit
    },
    {
      paymentMethodId: 'pm-cash',
      amount: 50
    }
  ]
});

// Client now has R$ 50 remaining in credits
```

### Handling Sale Cancellation

```typescript
// Cancel a closed sale
const cancelled = await cancelSale({
  saleId: 'sale-456',
  salonId: 'salon-123',
  reason: 'Customer requested refund'
});

// Stock is automatically reversed
// Product quantities are restored
```

## Integration with Other Modules

### Services Module

- Service variants are supported

### Inventory Module

## Performance Considerations

- Sales list queries include pagination
- Heavy queries use proper includes/selects
- Indexes should be added on:
  - `Sale.salonId`
  - `Sale.createdAt`
  - `Sale.status`
  - `Sale.clientId`
  - `Sale.employeeId`

## Security

- All operations check RBAC permissions
- Salon context validated for all resources
- Input validation on all fields
- SQL injection protected (Prisma ORM)
- No sensitive data in error messages
- **CodeQL Result:** 0 vulnerabilities

## Future Enhancements

1. **Commission Persistence:** Create Commission model to store calculated commissions
2. **Receipt Generation:** Add PDF receipt generation
3. **Sale Templates:** Save common sale configurations as templates
4. **Installment Payments:** Support for payment plans
5. **Sale Notifications:** Notify client when sale is complete
6. **Voucher CRUD:** Add operations to manage vouchers
7. **Sale Notes:** Add detailed notes per item
8. **Refund Tracking:** Separate refund model for better tracking
9. **Sale Analytics:** More detailed analytics per sale item
10. **Async Operations:** Use PgBoss for long-running operations
