## ðŸŽ‰ Completed Successfully!

This document summarizes the work completed for Sprint 2 of the Glamo salon management system.

## What Was Done

### 1. âœ… Services Module - Complete Implementation

Created a comprehensive Services module with full CRUD operations:

**Queries:**
- `listServices` - Search and paginate services
  - Supports search by name and description
  - Configurable pagination (default 20 per page)
  - Includes variants and commission config
  - Optional deleted services inclusion

- `getService` - Get detailed service information
  - Includes all variants
  - Includes commission configuration
  - Includes categories and service room

  - Automatically logs creation to audit trail

- `updateService` - Update existing services
  - Only updates provided fields
  - Re-validates service room if changed
  - Prevents update of deleted services
  - Logs before/after values for audit

- `deleteService` - Soft delete services
  - Prevents deletion if service has active appointments
  - Marks with `deletedAt` timestamp
  - Logs deletion to audit trail

- `createServiceVariant` - Add variants to services
  - Automatically sets `hasVariants = true` on parent service
  - Validates service exists and is not deleted
  - Supports same pricing/cost options as base service

- `updateServiceVariant` - Update existing variants
  - Prevents update of deleted variants
  - Validates variant belongs to salon

**File:** `app/src/services/operations.ts` (831 lines)

### 2. âœ… Commission Calculation Engine - Complete Implementation

Created a sophisticated commission calculator supporting multiple scenarios:

**Main Function:**
- `calculateCommission` - Routes to appropriate calculator based on scenario

**Scenario Calculators:**
- `calculateSoloCommission` - Professional working alone
  - Calculates commission on commissionable base
  - Deducts cost and non-commissionable values
  - Returns detailed breakdown

- `calculateWithAssistantCommission` - Professional with assistant(s)
  - Calculates professional's commission
  - Optionally deducts assistant commissions
  - Handles multiple assistants
  - Returns detailed breakdown

- `calculateAsAssistantCommission` - Working as an assistant
  - Calculates assistant's commission share
  - Based on commissionable base
  - Returns detailed breakdown

**Value Type Support:**
- FIXED - Absolute value (e.g., R$ 50)
- PERCENT - Percentage of base (e.g., 40%)

**Commissionable Base Calculation:**
1. Start with service price
2. Deduct cost value (FIXED or PERCENT)
3. Deduct non-commissionable value (FIXED or PERCENT)
4. Result is base for commission calculation

**Edge Cases Handled:**
- Negative values (prevented via validation)
- 100% solo commission
- 50/50 splits between professional and assistant
- Multiple assistants with proper deduction
- Zero price services
- Commission values > base (capped at base)

**Utilities:**
- `calculateValue` - Converts FIXED/PERCENT to actual amount
- `formatCurrency` - Formats currency for display (PT-BR)
- `formatPercentage` - Formats percentage for display

**File:** `app/src/services/commissionCalculator.ts` (277 lines)

**Example Scenarios:**

```typescript
// Solo: 100 price, 10 cost, 50% commission
// Commissionable base: 90 (100 - 10)
// Commission: 45 (50% of 90)

// With Assistant: 100 price, 10 cost, 40% prof, 10% asst, deduct=true
// Commissionable base: 90
// Professional: 27 (40% - 10% = 30% of 90)
// Assistant: 9 (10% of 90)

// As Assistant: 100 price, 10 cost, 15% commission
// Commissionable base: 90
// Commission: 13.50 (15% of 90)
```

### 3. âœ… Appointments Module - Complete Implementation
